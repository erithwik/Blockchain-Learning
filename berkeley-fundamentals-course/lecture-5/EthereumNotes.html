		<h1 class="display-4">Smart Contracts</h1>
		<hr>
		<p class="lead definition-gray">Code that facilitates, verifies, or enforces the negotiation or execution of a digital contract. A trusted entity must run this code.</p>
		<p class="lead">Essentially, it is like a regular contract between two groups but this contract is fully enforced by code.</p>
	</div>

		<h1 class="display-4">What is Ethereum?</h1>
		<hr style="background: white">
		<li class="lead">It is a decentralized platform designed to run smart contracts. It is like a distributed computer that executes code (everyone runs the code and we come to a consensus on the output), and it is a distributed state machine. It also has ether. It is also account based while Bitcoin is UTXO based.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li class="lead">In bitcoin, a state is how much money (how many utxos) each person has, but in Ethereum, each state is how much money each person has alongside what the values are in each of the smart contract's variables, who has ownership on theses non-coin items, etc.</li>	
		<br>
		<li class="lead">Every node executs Ethereum smart contracts, and then comes to a consensus on the new network state.</li>
		<div class="lead definition-white" style="margin-top: 1em">Smart Contracts in Ethereum are like autonomous agents that live inside the Ethereum Network. They react to external world when they are poked by transactions which call specific functions. They have direct control over: 
			<li>Internal Ether Balance</li>
			<li>Internal Contract State</li>
		<br>
		<p>Essentially, the smart contracts handle all the finances given the certain restrictions and algorithms the users give it, so that the users don't have to make any calculations by themselves.</p>

			<h1 class="display-4">Purposes of Smart Contracts</h1>
			<hr>
			<li class="lead">Store and maintain data</li>
			<p class="lead definition-gray" style="margin-top: .5em">Data represents something useful to others or other contracts.</p>
			<li class="lead">Manage contact or relationships between untrusting (or anonymous users)</li>
			<p class="lead definition-gray" style="margin-top: .5em">Financial contracts, escrow, insurance, betting. For example, lets say that you are buying something from a person. You put money into the smart contract, but the smart contract doesn't send the money to the other person until it is sure that the other person has met all the requirements to recieve the item (such as finishing all the paperwork or completely sending the item). If the smart contract sees that the vendor is doing something sketchy, then it won't complete the transaction. It is essentially the middleman that's alwyas accurate and doesn't need trusting.</p>
			<li class="lead">Providing functions to other contracts</li>
			<p class="lead definition-gray" style="margin-top: 1em ">Such as some algorithms that can be useful in other smart contracts. Smart contracts can call each other.</p>
			<li class="lead">Complex authentication</li>
			<p class="lead definition-gray" style="margin-top: .5em">Such as we need M of N signatures to do something sorta things.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="jumbotron text-white" style="background: gray">
			<h1 class="display-4">EVM Gas and Fees</h1>
			<hr style="background: white">
			<p class="lead">Every contract requires gas which feuls the contract execution. Every transaction specifies the startgas -> maximum quanitity of gas it is willing to consume and the gas price -> fee in ether it is willing to pay per unit of gas. So overall consumption of ether = startgas * gasprice. This gas will be paid to the person who runs the smart contract.</p>
			<p class="lead definition-white">So essentially, when you are purchasing gas, you are essentially purchasing distributed, trustless, computational power.</p>
			<p class="lead">So essentially, everyone in the network, in trying to add a block to the network, is running the smart contracts that are in the mempool in their own EVM, but they don't get rewarded until a block actually gets added to the blockchain. This means that you need to only have enough gas for one person to run the code because the person who adds the block will be the only person to get rewarded.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="jumbotron">
			<h1 class="display-4">Computation</h1>
			<hr>
			<p class="lead">Ethereum is not about optimizing efficiency of computation because it is redundantly parallel as everyone on the network is running the same code. It is simply a way to reach consensus on the system state without needed trusted third parties. This also creates an incentive not to use blockchain for computation that can be done off chain. </p>

			<div class="col-6">
				<p class="lead" style="font-size: 25px;">Good Use Cases for Blockchain</p>
				<li class="lead">Need of a shared database with parties that don't trust each other</li>
				<li class="lead">Interest in fault-tolerance, data immutability, or censorship resistance.</li>
			</div>
			<div class="col-6">
				<p class="lead" style="font-size: 25px;">Bad Use Cases for Blockchain</p>
				<li class="lead">Database doesn't need to be shared</li>
				<li class="lead ">Data must be kept confidential (can work through encryption for blockchain but not in most cases)</li>
				<li class="lead">Must handle Complex and/or large amounts of data</li>
				<li class="lead">Need to be able to edit past data</li> 
				<li class="lead">Interested in efficiency (sadly Machine Learning).</li>

			<h1 class="display-4">Supply Chain</h1>
			<hr>
			<p class="lead">The idea is that we can track our supply chain infromation through blockchain, and so in the business side of things, we can have efficient transactions through smart contracts, easy tracking, and recalls while on the consumer side, we can have a transparent record of products, and have applications in fair trade, sustainablility, and ethical consumerism.</p>
			<hr>
			<p class="lead">Other reasons for blockchain include prediction markets for hedging and insurance, security bug bounty, and ICO signalling. For example, lets say that you create a bet: "Will my house burn down" by 2020. People will buy shares of either the "yes" choice or the "no" choice. Whoever wins the bet, those shares will be valid and the shares of the "no" choice will not be valid. So if the house does burns down, you can get insured in the form of the shares for "yes" (which have a certain value of eth), and if not, it is like you are paying insurance to your insurer, but in this case, it is a group of different individuals in the blockchain who voted "no".</p>
