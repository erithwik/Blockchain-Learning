		<h1 class="display-4">What is Ethereum?</h1>
		<hr>
		<p class="lead">It is a decentralized platform designed to run smart contracts. It is like a distributed computer that executes code (everyone runs the code and we come to a consensus on the output), and it is a distributed state machine. It also has ether. It is also account based while Bitcoin is UTXO based.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="lead">In bitcoin, a state is how much money (how many utxos) each person has, but in Ethereum, each state is how much money each person has alongside what the values are in each of the smart contract's variables, who has ownership on theses non-coin items, etc.</p>
